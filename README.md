I developed a Java-based application that simulates and analyzes simple DC resistive circuits. The program parses circuit descriptions from user input, supports resistors and voltage sources, and outputs the corresponding SPICE representation. I implemented the logic to model components, maintain circuit connectivity, and generate accurate SPICE code. Additionally, I wrote unit tests to validate functionality and ensure robust behaviour, reinforcing my skills in object-oriented design, file parsing, and JUnit testing.
