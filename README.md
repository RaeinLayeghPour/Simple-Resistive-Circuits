# Simple Resistive Circuits

A desktop Java application for modelling, analyzing, and visualizing basic resistive circuits, helpful for electronics students and hobbyists.

---

## Key Features

- Build simple circuits with **series** and **parallel** resistors  
- Calculate **total resistance**, **current**, and **voltage drops**  
- Visualize circuit structure through a basic GUI (Swing or JavaFX)  
- Export results via console or CSV  
- Input via GUI panels or simple text-based configuration

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java (JDK 8 or later)  
- **UI Framework:** Swing or JavaFX  
- **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle  
- **Data Handling:** Built-in Java Collections + CSV export  
- **Testing:** JUnit for core calculations

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Set up resistors in series or parallel using the GUI or a text file.  
2. **Calculation**: The app computes total resistance and uses Ohmâ€™s Law to determine current and voltage drops.  
3. **Visualization**: Displays a simple schematic and result table.  
4. **Export**: Save analysis results via console output or CSV file.
